## Examples

Since we are using MetaPost, MetaFun, and Nodes, there are diagrams which have been taken essentially as is from the following documentation:

[**Nodes** documentation](www.pragma-ade.nl/general/manuals/nodes.pdf). The source of the `nodes` documentation can be found in the ConTeXt installation in the `tex/texmf-context/doc/context/sources/general/manuals/nodes` directory. The examples taken from this documentation are used under the following license:
